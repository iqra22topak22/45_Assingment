//25_ Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green',
//  'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)





//creat a veriable called aline _color
let alien_color: string ="green";

//write if  statement to test whether the alien's color is green.if it is , print a massage that the player just earned 5 points 
if (alien_color ==="green"){
    console.log("player just earned 5 points!");

}
//write  one virson of this progrm that the if test and other that fails .

 alien_color ="yellow";

// (the virsion that  fails will have no output)

if (alien_color ==="green"){
    console.log("player just earned 5 points!");
